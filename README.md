For some reason I was unable to get the database to actually print it's contents on the webpage. As seen in the console log, the add and delete commands both work and update the database entries correctly.  However, I couldn't find a way to get the data to priunt on screen.

Initially, I had intended to include 'delete' buttons next to each movie on the list, rather than using a search box, but since the database entries wouldn't load I quickly changed my delete approach at the last minute.

## Technical Achievements
- ** Dynamic search printing **: The search option begins to search as soon as input is included in the form.  Additionally, user input in the search box is printed below 
								 with a nice <span> element feature.
- ** URL update **: URl updates without reloading for the client.

### Design Achievements
- ** Applicable image background **: Included a movie background which adds color and meaning to the program.
- ** Span for importance **: Included span tags on user input with appropriate styling to make very apparent what the user is searching/adding/deleting.
