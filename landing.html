              As a child, I used to enjoy learning new things and discovering the world around me. I would either lock myself in a room to read my big and colorful books about superheroes, vehicles and animals or go to a park with my mom to play. However, I didn’t feel the need to make new friends because I had all the fun I needed when I was by myself.</span><span class = "purpletxt"> As I grew up, my parents were proud of having a smart child but they believed that I would eventually develop social issues if I didn’t learn how to make friends. They would also describe me as one of the happiest and careless kids they have ever seen which is probably why I didn’t feel like socializing was a necessity.</span>
